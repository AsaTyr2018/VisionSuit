# Project Silverleaf – Low-Severity Community Foundations

Project Silverleaf captures the community-facing updates from the feasibility review that carry a severity rating of 4–5. These workstreams offer the fastest path to visible improvements and can be scheduled as early content refreshes while heavier initiatives incubate.

## Scope of Updates
- **Curated collection curation enhancements** – Allow curators to assemble public or private collections that mix models and galleries (Severity 4).
- **Community guidelines acknowledgement flow** – Surface a reusable banner and persist acknowledgement state for each account (Severity 5).
- **Extended auditing on community records** – Add audit columns that align with the existing `createdAt`/`updatedAt` pattern (Severity 4).
- **Experience tracking through surveys** – Establish a feedback loop to monitor satisfaction >4/5 (Severity 5).

## Content Update Strategy
1. **Elevate documentation and onboarding copy**
   - Update help center language to explain new collection flexibility and the guidelines acknowledgement experience.
   - Provide short-form copy for UI banners and tooltips outlining acknowledgement requirements and privacy expectations.
2. **UI/UX micro-adjustments**
   - Extend gallery-related screens with inline cues that highlight mixed collection support without overwhelming existing layouts.
   - Design a slim banner component that can appear across shell pages and dismiss once acknowledgement is recorded.
3. **Data visibility improvements**
   - Document how audit fields surface in admin exports and activity logs so moderators understand accountability touchpoints.
   - Plan lightweight dashboard tiles or report snippets that visualize satisfaction trends as survey data is collected.

## Technical Considerations
- Schema updates are limited to augmenting existing tables with acknowledgement and audit metadata, minimizing migration risk.
- Frontend changes can reuse established layout primitives; no new navigation or deep component hierarchies are required.
- Survey collection can start with embedded external tools while long-term telemetry is evaluated, keeping engineering effort modest.

## Dependencies & Sequencing
- Coordinate with legal/compliance stakeholders for the wording of the guidelines acknowledgement prior to rollout.
- Ensure analytics or survey tooling is available before publicizing satisfaction tracking to avoid empty dashboards.
- Schedule the work ahead of higher-severity programs to build momentum and gather early community sentiment data.
