# Project Novashield – High-Severity Community Platform Overhaul

Project Novashield groups all roadmap elements scored at severity 8–9. These initiatives redefine how the community collaborates, requiring deep schema overhauls, new infrastructure, and sustained operational readiness.

## Scope of Updates
- **Advanced reactions governance** – Enforce daily like quotas and anti-spam safeguards (Severity 8).
- **Threaded discussions** – Deliver contextual comment threads, rich-text composition with attachments, and inline moderation/flagging pipelines (Severity 8–9).
- **Personalized discovery** – Build a personal feed for followed entities and craft weekly email or in-app digests (Severity 8–9).
- **Reputation systems** – Launch reputation ledgers, tiered badges with unlockable perks, and supporting admin controls (Severity 8).
- **Moderation & safety enhancements** – Implement flagging queues, shadow bans, and automated throttling (Severity 8–9).
- **Notification ecosystem** – Stand up an in-app notification center, deliver webhook integrations, and manage unread counts (Severity 8–9).
- **Data model expansion** – Create `Comment`, `CommentThread`, `CommentReaction`, `ReputationLedger`, and `Notification` entities with full lifecycle tracking (Severity 8).
- **Real-time & bulk APIs** – Provide WebSocket/SSE channels, bulk moderator endpoints, and event-driven webhook delivery (Severity 8–9).
- **Frontend deep rebuilds** – Ship a comment composer with moderation controls, a notification drawer plus full-page feed, and expanded profile surfaces (Severity 8).
- **Infrastructure uplift** – Deploy background workers (BullMQ), Redis caching layers, and search indexing services for comment/collection discovery (Severity 8–9).
- **Rollout milestones** – Execute milestone waves M1–M4 covering reactions foundation, feed/notifications, collaborative reputation layers, and analytics/digest maturity (Severity 8–9).
- **Operational targets** – Achieve median flag response under 12 hours and a 20% engagement uplift from follows/digests (Severity 8).

## Content Update Strategy
1. **Narrative arcs for major launches**
   - Plan campaign-style announcements for each milestone (M1–M4) to articulate the platform evolution and set user expectations.
   - Develop long-form documentation that explains moderation protocols, reputation mechanics, and notification management.
2. **Safety & trust communication**
   - Publish comprehensive guides for flagging misuse, understanding throttling behavior, and managing shadow bans with transparency.
   - Offer clear consent and opt-in messaging for digest emails, covering legal compliance and unsubscribe flows.
3. **Ecosystem enablement**
   - Prepare integration playbooks for webhook consumers, outlining event schemas, retries, and security signatures.
   - Curate tutorials that show creators how to leverage comment threads, badges, and feeds to build sustained engagement.

## Technical Considerations
- Background workers and Redis introduce new deployment topologies; invest in infrastructure-as-code and observability before launch.
- Real-time channels necessitate authentication hardening and scalability planning to avoid regressions in existing REST traffic.
- Reputation and moderation systems should share a central rules engine to reduce duplication and support future policy tweaks.
- Search indexing must balance latency with consistency, potentially favoring managed services to minimize operational burden.

## Dependencies & Sequencing
- Project Ironquill deliverables (reaction primitives, follow graph, audit logging) must be complete before Novashield work begins.
- Establish governance councils or moderator cohorts early so tooling can be co-designed with actual operators.
- Stagger rollouts to beta audiences to validate infrastructure under load prior to general availability campaigns.
- Align legal, compliance, and data protection reviews with the digest and webhook features to avoid launch delays.
