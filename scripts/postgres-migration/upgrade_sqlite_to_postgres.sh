[upgrade] Planned workflow (not yet implemented):
  Step 1. Enable maintenance mode via maintenance.sh or the admin API to freeze writes.
  Step 2. Create a timestamped backup copy of ${SQLITE_PATH} and archive it for rollback.
  Step 3. Export SQLite data and import it into PostgreSQL at ${POSTGRES_URL}.
          - Use Prisma migrate diff or pgloader to translate schemas.
          - Preserve Prisma migration history to keep deploys aligned.
  Step 4. Run automated verification:
          - prisma db pull && prisma migrate status
          - Targeted smoke tests that issue read/write checks against PostgreSQL.
  Step 5. Update environment configuration to point DATABASE_URL at PostgreSQL.
  Step 6. Restart backend services and confirm health probes pass.
  Step 7. Disable maintenance mode and monitor logs for anomalies.
  Step 8. Provide a rollback function that restores the SQLite file and reverts env settings
          if validation fails.

cat <<'TODO'
[upgrade] TODO: Implement the following helpers during development:
  - Automatic invocation of prepare_postgres_target.sh with credentials.
  - Integrity check comparing row counts between SQLite and PostgreSQL.
  - Structured logging for each migration phase to assist with audit trails.
  - Optional dry-run flag that performs all checks without switching production traffic.
