# Placeholder script for preparing a remote PostgreSQL database host.

Usage: $0 <postgres_connection_url>

This placeholder currently only echoes the supplied PostgreSQL connection URL.
Future revisions will perform the following checks automatically:
  - Ensure the host is reachable and the PostgreSQL service responds.
  - Create the target database and user when missing.
  - Confirm required extensions (e.g., pg_trgm) are installed when Prisma needs them.
  - Validate SSL/TLS enforcement to avoid plaintext credentials in transit.
